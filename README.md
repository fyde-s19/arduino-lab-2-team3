1. The duty cycle of the led is increasing as the led is getting brighter from the potentiometer setting.
2. The decoded messages are bytes of information represented as hexadecimal numbers in WaveForms.
3.  It takes around 3 seconds.
4.  It takes 1.917ms.
5. Once the necessary code was commented out, we were not able to measure any I/O using the logic analyzer
6. Same as number 6
7. You are able to see the data that is sent/received in serial monitor debugging, but it does not allow you to see timestamps. While using the logic analyzer we are able to see the statuses of multiple pins. This allows us to view wavelengths along with digital states at the same time. This is also a minimally intrusive method.
8. They need to have the same reference point in order to measure differences.
